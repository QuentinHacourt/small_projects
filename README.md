# small_projects

Welcome to my small projects repository.

I'll use this repository to hava a back up of my small programming projects I do when I learn a new language.

This readme will also be a place where I store useful links for learning whatever I'm working on.

## Golang

Golang is a programming language which is really good in getting the most out of multicore and networked machines.

## Elixir & Phoenix

Phoenix is a web development framework based on the functional programming language elixir.

## Dart & Flutter

Flutter is a framework used to make mobile applications and web apps.

Dart is the programming language that you need to know in order to work with flutter.
